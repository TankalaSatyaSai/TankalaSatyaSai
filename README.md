I am [Satya Sai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tankala-satya-sai-b12b22223/), a 4th-year undergraduate student in the [Engineering Design Department](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I am an undergraduate student researcher in the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl-iitm.github.io/) at IIT Madras under [Prof. Bijo Sebastian](https://asl-iitm.github.io/bijosebastian/).

As part of my research, I am passionate about working on solving real-world industrial-oriented multi-robot collaboration problems as they offer me the opportunity to go deep and wide in different interconnected topics mentioned below:

* Kinematics 
* Localisation
* Path Planning and Navigation
* Collaborative Control
* Linear and Non-Linear Control methods
* Model Predictive Control
* ROS integrated frameworks
* Mechanical Design
* PCB Designing

I have been working in the Autonomous Systems Lab for the last 2 years, completed a set of projects, and decided on my current research goal. I've worked on 

1. Teleoperation of an outdated [P3AT robot](https://www.generationrobots.com/media/Pioneer3AT-P3AT-RevA-datasheet.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOoprwq7k9wcxx5JCujlxatwJbN86XygqlsCS4zd8gnC4aBWiR9IC) using ROSARIA bridge (Status:=Completed) 
2. Optimizing Artificial Landmark Placement for Improving Indoor Localization of [Mobile Robots](https://asl-iitm.github.io/mobile_robot/) (Status:=Completed) 
3. Outdoor Autonomous Robot (Status:=Paused)
4. [Multi-Robot Systems](https://asl-iitm.github.io/multi_agent_systems/)  (Status:=Current)      

Outside of my above project-specific interests, I am currently interested in

* Robot Learning (Deep Reinforcement Learning)
* Non-linear controls
* Hardware Design (manufacturability)
* Product Design
* ROS2
* Simulations for robotics (Issac sim, gazebo, etc)
* Sim-to-Real & Real-to-Sim

 ##Positions Of Responsibilities 

1. Current senior mentor and former head of [iBot club](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/clubs/ibot-club) at [Centre For Innovation](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/)
